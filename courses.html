        <h3>Maths A Level Revision Course (3 day)</h3>
        <article>
            <h4>Structure of the day</h4>
            <p>We generate long term success, this is not a short term revision bootcamp. Our days are all built around what our students need the most; how to interpret and unpick what a question is asking, selecting the relevant mathematics required and applying these processes correctly. You will develop the resilience to ‘think harder’ when things go wrong. 
                    <br><br>Our courses offer students structured, effective and efficient revision practice with a range of one-to-one tuition and small group work which propagates much more effective problem solving. During the classes students are able to consolidate what they have learned and get one to one tuition in areas they are struggling with.
                    <br><br>Students are given extensive past paper practice and draw on specimen questions and examiners’ reports to optimise their success in the final exams. Every student hears from an examiner during the course. 
                    <br><br>Each day students receive a written report on their progress with constructive feedback on performance and how they might improve in the future. This helps inspire the necessary focus in the lead up to their final examinations.

            <h4>Mindfullness and nutrition</h4>
            <p>The importance of well-being should not be underestimated as part of a student’s success and the rigors of the new Maths content and terminal examinations have only exacerbated the significance of it. A recent Health England study noted:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>pupils who are confident about their learning and who have a ‘growth mindset’ persist when faced with challenges</li>
                <li>pupils who can set goals, manage stress and organise their school work achieve higher grades</li>
                <li>pupils who use problem-solving skills to overcome obstacles do better academically</li>
            </ul>
            As such our courses have a wellbeing focus on:
            <ul>
                <li>Daily yoga courses and meditation exercises.</li>
                <li>Nutritious and homemade shakes, cold-pressed juices and raw foods for lunch which promote brain stimulation and the energy needed to work effectively.</li>
            </ul>

                <br><br>There is also access to our high quality ‘How To’ A-Level Maths tutorial available via our online platform. Access bespoke video content that transports our tutors into your home whenever you need them. An example of this content is below:

            <h4>Venue</h4>
            <p>We have chosen venues that are an escape from the normal school setting.  Our initial base is Teddington Cricket Club who have undergone a recent £1.7million new pavilion build. Based in Royal Bushy Park the setting is a tranquil mixture of waterways, gardens and grassland with roaming herds of red and fallow deer. The perfect setting for mindfulness.
